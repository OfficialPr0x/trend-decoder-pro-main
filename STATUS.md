## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES

### 1. Image Generation Not Returning Images
**Status:** In Progress  
**Issue:** `google/gemini-2.5-flash-image` model completes but doesn't return actual image URLs
**Impact:** Shows "Image Generation Coming Soon" placeholder
**Fix Needed:** 
- Verify Gemini image model response format
- May need to use DALL-E 3 instead: `openai/dall-e-3`
- Or use image generation models from OpenRouter that are confirmed working

### 2. Analysis Doesn't Download Video
**Status:** Not Implemented  
**Issue:** Current analysis only sends URL to AI, doesn't download/analyze frames
**Impact:** Analysis is text-based only, no visual frame analysis
**Fix Needed:**
- Implement `yt-dlp` video download
- Extract key frames (hook, middle, end)
- Use vision models to analyze frames
- Combine with metadata analysis

### 3. Model Selector Missing in Analyze Tab
**Status:** Need to Add  
**Issue:** Analyze tab uses hardcoded Claude model
**Impact:** Can't choose vision models for better analysis
**Fix Needed:**
- Add model dropdown in AnalyzeTab
- Filter for vision-capable models
- Save preference in settings

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

### Priority 1: Fix Image Generation
```typescript
// Test these models:
- openai/dall-e-3 (confirmed working)
- openai/dall-e-2 (backup)
- stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0 (alternative)
```

### Priority 2: Add Model Selector to Analyze Tab
- Fetch vision models from OpenRouter
- Add dropdown above "Analyze Video" button
- Persist model choice in settings

### Priority 3: Implement Video Download
- Add yt-dlp integration
- Extract frames at key timestamps
- Analyze frames with vision models
- Combine with URL analysis
