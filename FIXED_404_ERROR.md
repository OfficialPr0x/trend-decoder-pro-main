# 🔧 Fixed: OpenRouter 404 Error

## What Was the Problem?

The frontend was trying to call the OpenRouter API directly from the browser, which caused:
- ❌ **404 errors** because OpenRouter doesn't accept direct browser requests
- ❌ **CORS issues** blocking the API calls
- ❌ **Insecure API key storage** in browser localStorage

## What Was Fixed?

✅ **Updated Frontend** (`src/services/openrouter-api.ts`)
- All OpenRouter API calls now route through the backend server
- Removed localStorage API key dependency
- Better error handling and security

✅ **Updated Backend** (`backend/server-openrouter.js`)
- Added proxy endpoints for all OpenRouter functions:
  - `/api/openrouter/chat` - Text completions
  - `/api/openrouter/image` - Image generation
  - `/api/openrouter/video` - Video storyboard generation
  - `/api/openrouter/vision` - Vision analysis
  - `/api/openrouter/ideas` - Viral content ideas

✅ **Updated CreateTab** (`src/components/sidebar/CreateTab.tsx`)
- Removed localStorage API key check
- Added backend server connection reminder
- Updated error messages

## How to Use It Now

### Step 1: Set Up OpenRouter API Key

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder:

```bash
cd backend
cp env.example .env
```

Edit `backend/.env` and add your OpenRouter API key:
```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
PORT=3001
```

Get your API key from: https://openrouter.ai/keys

### Step 2: Install Backend Dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### Step 3: Start the Backend Server

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

You should see:
```
VIRALIFY API with OpenRouter running on port 3001
```

### Step 4: Reload the Chrome Extension

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Click the reload icon on the VIRALIFY extension
3. Navigate to any TikTok video
4. Open the VIRALIFY sidebar

### Step 5: Test It Out

Go to the **Create Tab** and try generating an image or video storyboard!

## Architecture Now

```
Browser Extension (Frontend)
    ↓
    → http://localhost:3001/api/openrouter/*
    ↓
Backend Server (Node.js)
    ↓
    → https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/*
    ↓
OpenRouter API → AI Models
```

## Benefits

✅ **Secure**: API key stays on the server, never exposed to browser  
✅ **No CORS Issues**: Backend handles all cross-origin requests  
✅ **Better Error Handling**: Centralized error management  
✅ **Easier Debugging**: All API calls logged in backend console  

## Troubleshooting

### "Backend server not running" error
- Make sure you ran `npm start` in the `backend` folder
- Check that port 3001 is not being used by another app

### "OpenRouter API error" messages
- Verify your API key is correct in `backend/.env`
- Check you have credits in your OpenRouter account
- Some models may not be available or may have rate limits

### Extension not working after reload
- Make sure you rebuilt the extension: `npm run build`
- Reload the extension in `chrome://extensions/`
- Try closing and reopening the browser

## Next Steps

- [ ] Get OpenRouter API key from https://openrouter.ai
- [ ] Create `backend/.env` file with your API key
- [ ] Start backend server with `npm start`
- [ ] Reload the Chrome extension
- [ ] Test image/video generation in Create Tab

Happy creating! 🚀🎬✨
